Development and successful implementation of the crop yield prediction model using a feed forward neural network, with inputs encompassing soil nutrients, environmental conditions, and economic factors, mark a significant advancement in precision agriculture. The high accuracy of 97% underscores the model's efficacy in capturing complex relationships within agricultural systems.

This project not only demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in agriculture but also highlights the importance of a holistic approach to yield prediction. The integration of diverse input variables enables the model to offer nuanced insights, empowering farmers to make informed decisions that optimize resources, enhance productivity, and contribute to sustainable farming practices.
